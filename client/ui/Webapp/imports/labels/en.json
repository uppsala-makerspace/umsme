  "MembershipsText": "Liability Agreement version: 210912\n\nLab members at Uppsala Makerspace can get their own access and be in the space to work on their projects when it suits them. To facilitate collaboration and ensure a fun and safe environment, we have established the following simple rules. Members who abuse this trust may be suspended for a longer or shorter period.\n\nAccess to the premises:\n• Visitors are welcome, especially during open evenings, but regular access to the space requires lab membership in the association.\n• If I let in someone who is not a lab member, I am personally responsible for everything they do. Membership can be verified at uppsalamakerspace.se/medlem/.\n• The last person to leave the space ensures that all machines are turned off, windows are closed, lights are off, and the inner door is shut and locked.\n\nOrder and tidiness:\n• After a work session, trash should be cleaned up and tools returned. As a rule, the space should be left in the same or better condition than when you arrived.\n• Personal belongings and parts of ongoing projects are stored in a personal bin on the designated shelf. Larger items may be stored temporarily in the storage room in designated areas if labeled and space allows. Label with name, phone number, and estimated project completion date.\n• Food may only be consumed in the kitchen and lounge but must not be left out. Drugs and alcoholic beverages are not allowed in the space. Clean up after yourself—pour out old coffee, discard apple cores, and remove anything that might mold.\n\nSafety:\n• In the wood and metal workshops, long hair must be tied back, loose clothing avoided, and protective equipment used.\n• For your own and others' safety, and to prevent damage, only use tools you are confident in handling. If unsure, ask others for advice or refrain from use.\n• Some tools may have specific usage requirements posted nearby—these must be followed.\n• It's important to be familiar with where the first aid kit and fire extinguishers are located.\n\nCommunity:\n• Conversations are held in a respectful tone, and it goes without saying that we help each other and share our experiences.\n• We respect when someone needs to concentrate and avoid unnecessary interruptions."
